# Franka

Franka is a programming language implemented as a library. While this approach is unconventional it has many 
advantages: 

* There is no new syntax to learn (only a well-documented API).
* Language bindings allow you to use it from any environment. 
* Franka code can be generated or processed programatically without any additional effort (no need for complex parsers).
