# Franka

Franka's goal is to bring some unity into the fragmented world of software development. We don's speak the same language 

* Business users bring their domain expertise,
* software developers bring technical experience and
* machines write flawless code.

## Core Principles

### Stop inventing, start integrating

Fragmentation is our enemy so we don't contribute to it. Franka merely takes what is out there and makes it accessible 
in different environments. We don't invent new things, we innovate through integration!

### Embrace the change

Even though our world is changing at an ever increasing pace our programming languages assume that it's static. As a 
result we are forced to handle changes externally using complex release processes. Franka is different! It provides 
primitives for making atomic changes to your application much like in a relational database where you can gradually 
alter a schema instead of releasing a completely new version every time.
