# Franka

Franka is a portable programming language implemented as a library. While this approach is unconventional it has many 
advantages: 

* There is no new syntax to learn (only a well-documented API).
* Language bindings allow you to use it from any environment. 
* Franka code can be generated or processed without any additional effort (no need for complex parsers).

Franka's goal is to bring unity into the fragmented world of software development. It provides a platform where software 
developers, business users and machines can collaborate as equal partners with different strengths but a common goal.

* Business users bring their domain expertise,
* software developers bring technical experience and
* machines write flawless code.

## Core Principles

### Stop inventing, start integrating

Fragmentation is our enemy so we don't contribute to it. Franka merely takes what is out there and makes it accessible 
in different environments. We don't invent new things, we innovate through integration!

### Embrace the change

Even though our world is changing at an ever increasing pace our programming languages assume that it's static. As a 
result we are forced to handle changes externally using complex release processes. Franka is different! It provides 
primitives for making atomic changes to your application much like in a relational database where you can gradually 
alter a schema instead of releasing a completely new version every time.
