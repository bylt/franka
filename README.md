# Franka

Franka's goal is to bring unity into the fragmented world of software development. It provides a platform where software developers, business users and machines can collaborate as equal partners with different strengths but the same goal. Software developers bring their technical expertise, business users provide domain knowledge and machines write flawless code.

## Principles

### Stop inventing, start integrating

Fragmentation is our enemy so we don't contribute to it. Franka merely takes what is out there and makes it reusable in different environments. We don't invent new things, we innovate through integration!

### Embrace the change

Everybody knows that our world is constantly changing yet to this day programming languages are built without first class support for it. Our tools assume that the world is static and change is handled externally using release processes. Franka is different! It provides primitives for making atomic changes to your application much like in a relational database where you "create" and "alter".
