# Franka

Franka's goal is to bring unity into the fragmented world of software development. It provides a platform where software 
developers, business users and machines can collaborate as equal partners who have different strengths but a common goal.
 
> Software developers bring their technical expertise, business users provide domain knowledge and machines write flawless 
> code.

## Core Principles

### Stop inventing, start integrating

Fragmentation is our enemy so we don't contribute to it. Franka merely takes what is out there and makes it reusable in 
different environments. We don't invent new things, we innovate through integration!

### Embrace the change

Even though our world is changing at an ever increasing pace the programming languages we use assume that it's static. 
As a result we are forced to handle changes externally using complex release processes. Franka is different! It provides 
primitives for making atomic changes to your application much like in a relational database where you can gradually 
alter a schema instead of releasing a completely new version every time.
